# Summary

School Survivor is a simple 2D game where the player collects good marks and avoids bad marks.

## Detailed Summary

The goal of this game is to collect A marks that fly through the air. At the same time, the player must avoid F marks moving across the game's screen. When the player hits an F mark, the game ends. The highest score, representing the number of collected A marks, is recorded for each game session. The game tries to prepare future students for situations where collecting F marks may result in the termination of their studies. During the game, it is possible for multiple F marks to spawn in such a way that the player won't be able to dodge them at all - this situation aims to prepare future students for the fact that life is not always fair.

## Screens
The game consists of two main screens. The first screen is the Welcome screen, which waits for the user to press space to start the game. The second screen is where the game itself takes place. After a collision with an F mark, the player is redirected back to the Welcome screen, where they can start the game again.
